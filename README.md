# Rock Paper Scissors Game ðŸŽ®

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built in Python where a player competes against the computer (CPU). The CPU randomly selects between Rock, Paper, or Scissors using Python's `random` module.

## ðŸ“œ How It Works
- The player is prompted to enter a choice between **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
- The CPU randomly generates a choice using Python's `random.choice()` function.
- The winner is determined based on the standard Rock Paper Scissors rules:
    - **Rock beats Scissors**
    - **Scissors beats Paper**
    - **Paper beats Rock**
- The game then displays the winners: Player or CPU
